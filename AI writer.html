<h1>Two Sympathetic Uncles Kicking to the Beat<br>
</h1>
<h2>A Short Story<br>
  by Unknown</h2>
<div>
  <p>Harvey Yang looked at the enchanted enchanted sword in his hands and felt stressed.</p>
  <p>He walked over to the window and reflected on his old-fashioned surroundings. He had always loved noisy Manhattan with its tasty, tall trees, peoples, Allens, Glorias, Sunnys. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel stressed.</p>
  <p>Then he saw something in the distance, or rather some<em>one</em>. It was the figure of Eric Cao. Eric was a courageous demigod with Veiny Arms and Long legs.</p>
  <p>Harvey gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a mean, energetic, soft drink drinker with Huge Arms and Thick legs. His friends saw him as a great, gleaming GOD. Once, he had even rescued a xanthocarpous deaf person from a burning building.</p>
  <p>But not even a mean person who had once rescued a xanthocarpous deaf person from a burning building, was prepared for what Eric had in store today. </p>
  <p>The rainy teased like rampaging dogs, making Harvey surprised. </p>
  <p>As Harvey stepped outside and Eric came closer, he could see the rough smile on his face.</p>
  <p>"I am here because I want revenge," Eric bellowed, in a smart tone. He slammed his fist against Harvey's chest, with the force of 6327 Cats. "I frigging hate you, Harvey Yang."</p>
  <p>Harvey looked back, even more surprised and still fingering the enchanted enchanted sword. "Eric, I want to kill you," he replied.</p>
  <p>They looked at each other with shocked feelings, like two warty, wide wolfs banging at a very incredible a normal day, which had jazz music playing in the background and two sympathetic uncles kicking to the beat.</p>
  <p>Suddenly, Eric lunged forward and tried to punch Harvey in the face. Quickly, Harvey grabbed the enchanted enchanted sword and brought it down on Eric's skull.</p>
  <p>Eric's Veiny Arms trembled and his Long legs wobbled. He looked anxious, his body raw like a sad, shaggy shimmering sheild.</p>
  <p>Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Eric Cao was dead.</p>
  <p>Harvey Yang went back inside and made himself a nice drink of soft drink.</p>
  THE END </div>
<p>Comments: I think this work is pretty good but there are some of the grammar problem where the AI writer could have changed. Also, I think the AI writer could be more intrsting and not just one kind of plot over and over. It allhad only one template and only little bit of the words where changed. :)<br>
<p> Also, let me show you another story:
	It had been a long time since anyone had seen the Man of Steel on Earth. He was already a god among humans, but his presence on Mars was even more awe-inspiring. As soon as he arrived, people stopped what they were doing and bowed their heads in reverence.

He felt the same way about them. It wasn't often that he got to interact with humanity in such a personal way, and he relished every moment. He seemed to inspire everyone he met, no matter their station in life.

It didn't take long for word of his arrival to spread across the red planet, and soon people from all corners were converging on sight of him. They came bearing gifts - food, water, medicine - anything that might help him during his stay.

The Supes accepted everything with grace, but there was something special about being given love instead of appeasement. It humbled him in a way nothing else could. And it made him want to return home even more than ever before."

<h1>Two Sympathetic Uncles Kicking to the Beat<br>
</h1>
<h2>A Short Story<br>
  by Unknown</h2>
<div>
  <p>Harvey Yang looked at the enchanted enchanted sword in his hands and felt stressed.</p>
  <p>He walked over to the window and reflected on his old-fashioned surroundings. He had always loved noisy Manhattan with its tasty, tall trees, peoples, Allens, Glorias, Sunnys. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel stressed.</p>
  <p>Then he saw something in the distance, or rather some<em>one</em>. It was the figure of Eric Cao. Eric was a courageous demigod with Veiny Arms and Long legs.</p>
  <p>Harvey gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a mean, energetic, soft drink drinker with Huge Arms and Thick legs. His friends saw him as a great, gleaming GOD. Once, he had even rescued a xanthocarpous deaf person from a burning building.</p>
  <p>But not even a mean person who had once rescued a xanthocarpous deaf person from a burning building, was prepared for what Eric had in store today. </p>
  <p>The rainy teased like rampaging dogs, making Harvey surprised. </p>
  <p>As Harvey stepped outside and Eric came closer, he could see the rough smile on his face.</p>
  <p>"I am here because I want revenge," Eric bellowed, in a smart tone. He slammed his fist against Harvey's chest, with the force of 6327 Cats. "I frigging hate you, Harvey Yang."</p>
  <p>Harvey looked back, even more surprised and still fingering the enchanted enchanted sword. "Eric, I want to kill you," he replied.</p>
  <p>They looked at each other with shocked feelings, like two warty, wide wolfs banging at a very incredible a normal day, which had jazz music playing in the background and two sympathetic uncles kicking to the beat.</p>
  <p>Suddenly, Eric lunged forward and tried to punch Harvey in the face. Quickly, Harvey grabbed the enchanted enchanted sword and brought it down on Eric's skull.</p>
  <p>Eric's Veiny Arms trembled and his Long legs wobbled. He looked anxious, his body raw like a sad, shaggy shimmering sheild.</p>
  <p>Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Eric Cao was dead.</p>
  <p>Harvey Yang went back inside and made himself a nice drink of soft drink.</p>
  THE END </div>
<p>Comments: I think this work is pretty good but there are some of the grammar problem where the AI writer could have changed. Also, I think the AI writer is a bit too low leveled. It allhad only one template and only little bit of the words where changed. :)<br>

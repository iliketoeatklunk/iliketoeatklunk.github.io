<p>AI painter</p>
<p>AI painter is a kind of AI that helps peoples create pictures of a lot of things. For example, it can help you create landscapes, logos, portraits, painting, etc. In the AI painter, you use different kind of brushes to create different landscapes. For example, the two pictures below is created with a lot of different brushes, light blue(air), purple(mountains), blue(water), and grey(clouds).</p>
<p>For example, the two pictures below are made from two AI painter webs, both combined with a logo with photoshop. These two are different landscapes made with a AI painter. </p>
<p>The first one if a picture where there are a lot of stars like the cosmos with a very cool logo I chose to combine with photoshop.
	Then, the other one is a very strange but beautiful picture of a water splashing down, I chose a very complex picture of the YINYANG symbol and also combined it with photoshop.</p>
<p>To create this amazingly, beautifully made AI painter picture, I used a web called gaugan.com, it is very easy to use and most of its pictures are beautiful. But, you should start with the landscape section because it is the easiest to make a good picture.</p>

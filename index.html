<p>Hi, I am Allen. My pet just went away. Let me tell you a funny story.</p>
<p>One day, there once was a pig named Sunny. Then, his father Hollis asked him a question.</p>
<p>&quot; If me and your mother went to vacation, your mother goes to Paris, and I will go to China. Where will you go to?&quot;</p>
<p>Then, Sunny said, &quot; I will definetly go to Paris!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because Paris is pretty!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fine&quot;</p>
<p>Then, Hollis asked him another question.</p>
<p>&quot;How about this time I go to Paris and your mother goes to China. Who will you go to?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;of course China!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because I already went to Paris with mother from your first question!&quot;</p>
<p> This is the fun story I wanted to tell you. </p>
<p>I like to play baseball and read. Bye</p>
